# Reference Codes

The NWChemEx Project has been asked to compare the project codes against
state-of-the-art implementations of similar methods. The goal of this comparison
is to ensure that the performance of NWChemEx is similar to other
implementations, even though NWChemEx will focus primarily on scalability.

The methods that will be compared are:
   1. The canonical implementation of DFT
   2. The canonical MP2 implementation
   3. The canonical CCSD implementation
   4. The canonical CCSD(T) implementation
   5. The DL-PNO DFT implementation
   6. The DL-PNO MP2 implementation
   7. The DL-PNO CCSD implementation
   8. The DL-PNO CCSD(T) implementation
The state-of-the-art codes that we compare against have been chosen as:
   1. Psi4
   2. MOLPRO
   3. MPQC4

This directory contains various aides to help with the comparisons:
   1. Input files for a small tests that can be used as a starting point
   2. Jobscripts to run the small tests
   3. A description of what data to extract from the results

The data in this directory is organized by code.
